                <h3>Hobby 1: Soccer</h3>
                <p>Soccer has always been a central part of my life. Growing up playing the game taught me discipline, teamwork, and resilience—qualities I now bring into coaching youth soccer. I love being able to give back to the sport by helping young players grow both on and off the field. Whether I’m playing or coaching, soccer continues to be a lifelong passion that keeps me connected to a strong community and a game I’ll love forever.</p>

                <h3>Hobby 2: Outdoor Adventures</h3>
                <p>Spending time outdoors is one of my favorite ways to recharge. I enjoy going for walks, hiking local trails, and relaxing at the beach whenever I can. In the winter, I love downhill skiing at Spirit Mountain—it’s something I look forward to every season. Whether it's a quiet hike or a day on the slopes, being in nature gives me a sense of balance and perspective.</p>
